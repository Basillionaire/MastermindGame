Final project Mastermind game

I approached this assignment by splitting the work into three categories:
1. Turtle functions, 2. Game functions and 3. Clicking and position work. 
I tried my best to trade off which category I worked on every other day or so
because I knew there would be frustrating moments with this assignment and so
wanted to try and give myself time to process. The game functions
would include things like making the secret code, the count bulls and cows function
and resetting the circles. Turtle functions are the drawing functions and the
reason I originally separated them from positioning was just to get the objects
drawn, the dialog box running and gifs stamped somewhere. Basically I just needed to
relearn Turtle without making it overly complicated for myself. The clicking and
positioning category was because I needed to relearn how to position all these
objects in the right place and track everything with turtle. I thought
that it would be easy enough to test everything by making a GameRunner class in the
mastermind_game.py file which became my main file for doing everything. Then I created two
additional classes one for managing circle data and the other for managing image data.
I did not attempt any extra credit cases.
